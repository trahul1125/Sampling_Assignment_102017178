Project Overview

* Working on credit card data which contains imbalanced classes. Applying sampling techniques such as Undersampling and Oversampling to transform the dataset to have balanced classes. 

* Then, applying various other sampling techniques to create subsamples out of the main dataset. Techniques used:

1) Simple Random Sampling
2) Stratified Sampling
3) CLuster Sampling
4) Systemic Sampling 
5) Comvenience Sampling ( Non Probability Sampling Method)

* NOTE: Techniques 1 to 4 are Probability Sampling Methods.

Then, applied various machine learning models and tested accuracy to determine best results.

* ML models used:

1) Logistic Regression
2) SVM
3) Decision Trees
4) Random Forest
5) Gaussian Naive Bayes
